# FewGoodMen
FewGoodMen plugin
FewGoodMen is a TF2 SourceMod Plugin that adds a gamemode intended for arena matches called Few Good Men.
By calling a vote with /fgm or /dfgm, players can choose to enable or disable the gamemode.
With it enabled, at the end of each round, if a team has won 2 or more rounds in a row, it will be considered the "winning team".
At the start of each round, if a "winning team" has been established, a player deemed to be the least contributive is sent from the "winning team" to the "losing team".
Additionally, Few Good Men prevents anyone from joining the "winning team", and player contribution is based off of recent personal gains in score points.

Few Good Men is a gamemode designed to balance teams based on recent team victories and personal achievement.
It is an attempt to better the arena experience by mitigating steamrolls by manipulating team player count.

This plugin was especially made with the TF2 Dodgeball gamemode in mind, as the skill gap between players can be vast.
